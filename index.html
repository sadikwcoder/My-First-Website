    It was the time, when Allah aked before angles that I am going to creat my vicegerent to the earth. Angles said "are we not enough to praise of you?" <br> <br>
     Allah said to angles; Whatever I know, you do not know. It was really a wonderful dialog between two parties before creating a new creature. Here are two parties, oneside Allah subhanu watala Himself and others are His one of the great creation angles. <br><br>
     whenever I read this verse No. 30 of Surah Al Baqara, It gives me a sense that makes me surprise everysingle time that how much Allah subhanahu wa tawala loves. Generally we talk about always something that we like most. Here, Allah himself presenting a plan before His angles that He never do before doing others. Allah says it in Quran, Whenever I want to make something I just order for doing and it forms but before man Allah asking opinions to angles about his new creation. Do you think it a generel sens of means?

       <h4>Why Allah Sent Adam to earth</h4>
       <p>
           It was very initial time to heaven after creating Adam aw. Allah gave Him permition to enjoy the peace and baeauty into heaven but with an objection. Allah commanded him never go to close to a remarkable tree. <br>
        <br>
        Days went well but oneday, his wife Hawa aw came to him close with some fruits from forbidden tree. At the beginning Adam aw didn't mind to test it but suddenly he could remember the commandment of Allaah subhanu watala that He forbade them never even get closer to such tree. Alas! the fate undone.
